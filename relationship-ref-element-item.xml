  <title>The relationship_ref element information item</title>
  <para>
    relationship_ref element information items (referred to in this
    specification as relationship_ref elements) are element information items
    in the CellML 1.1 namespace with local name equal to relationship_ref.

    <title>Specific information items</title>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Every relationship_ref element MUST contain exactly one attribute
          information item with local name relationship. This limit of one
          attribute information item SHALL apply without regard to the
          namespace the attribute information item is in, and SHALL, to the
          extent that it conflicts, override the ordinary rules for extension
          information items. In the event that the relationship attribute
          is in the empty namespace, it MUST either take the value
          encapsulation or containment.

      <!-- if I didn't want to get rid of it due to definitional and ideological
           problems, I would also define name here. This is something which
           needs more discussion.
